	description = An innovative new docking/berthing solution, the Improved Androgynous Common Berthing Mechanism (IACBM) features integrated LED illumination units, in-flight toggle between Active/Passive guide fin configurations and a special "Hatch Mode" to allow crew to EVA from Karmony modules whose hatches would otherwise be blocked by competitors' docking ports. This 1.25 m diameter variant is designed for small to medium sized spacecraft.
